sudo pacman -U https://parabola.nu/packages/libre/any/parabola-keyring/download/
# Add the parabola mirrors
sudo pacman -U https:parabola.nu/packages/libre/any/pacman-mirrorlist/download/

# Change back /etc/pacman.conf
# Before the [core] repositories write:

[libre]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# After the [community] write:

[nonprism]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# Save the file

# Back up the "old" mirrorlist
cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.arch

# Put the mirrorlist.pacnew in place of the "old" mirrorlist
cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

sudo pacman -Scc
# Reply "yes" to both questions

sudo pacman -Suu pacman your-freedom your-privacy

# Renew grub
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# Using the AUR
create a function in ~/.bashrc, if using LARBS is "aurinstall()"
